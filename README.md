[![x43](docs/source/images/logo-dark.png)](docs/hangar.md)

A Python package to rapidly generate parametric geometries
defined by hyperpatches. Check out the 
[hangar](docs/source/hangar.md) for some examples.


## Installation

To install `hypervehicle`, use the command below.

```
pip install hypervehicle
